A ride-hailing API backend with WebSocket real-time events, Paystack payment integration, and k6 load testing. Designed for Lagos, Nigeria. Frontend PWA under development.

## Features

- REST API for full ride lifecycle (request → accept → start → complete → pay)
- Real-time WebSocket event system (driver location, ride state changes, payment status)
- Paystack payment orchestration (card, USSD, transfer, cash)
- JWT authentication with httpOnly refresh token rotation and email verification
- Role-based authorization (rider, driver, admin) with granular endpoint access
- Rate-limited auth endpoints, HMAC-signed webhooks, Zod input validation
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL — full migration history, strong consistency for payments
- k6 load testing suite — smoke, load, stress, and soak scenarios

### Infrastructure

- Docker Compose (PostgreSQL + Redis + API server)
- Dockerized deployment (ECS-ready via GitHub Actions)
- CI: lint + unit tests on push; CD: build → ECR → ECS deploy

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Docker Desktop

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InsituPeter/hail.git && cd hail/server
npm install
```

### 2. Start infrastructure

```bash
# From repo root
docker compose up -d
```

This starts PostgreSQL (port 5432) and Redis (port 6379).

### 3. Configure environment

Create `server/.env` with the following:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/hb
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
NODE_ENV=development
JWT_SECRET=<your-secret>
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<your-refresh-secret>
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=<paystack-secret>
PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY=<paystack-public>
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
COMPANY_NAME=Hail
SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@hail.com
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=<google-maps-key>
```

### 4. Run database migrations

```bash
docker exec -it hail npx prisma migrate dev
```

### 5. Start the server

```bash
# From server/
npm run dev          # hot reload via nodemon
```

### 6. Seed test data (optional)

```bash
docker exec -it hail node loadtest/seed.js
```

### 7. Run load tests (optional)

```bash
k6 run server/loadtest/scrripts/smoke.js
```

## Architecture

**Request flow:** Route (middleware) → Controller → Service → Repository → Prisma

**Dependency injection:** Manual DI via `container.js` — repositories are instantiated first, injected into services, which are injected into controllers. Routes are factory functions receiving their controller. Adding a new feature follows a predictable path across these layers.

**Real-time events:** Driver location updates → Redis pub/sub → Socket.IO → WebSocket clients. Ride state changes emit events to room-scoped channels.

**Payment flow:** Paystack webhook → `/webhook/paystack` → HMAC signature verification → `PaymentService.handlePaymentSuccess()` → Postgres + Redis event.

**Saga pattern:** `completeRide` initiates payment before marking the ride COMPLETED. If payment fails (Paystack outage, network error), the ride stays IN_PROGRESS and the driver retries — preventing inconsistent ride/payment states.

## Ride State Machine

```
REQUESTED → ACCEPTED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED

```

## User Flows

**Rider:** Register → verify email → login → create profile → request ride → track driver → ride complete → pay

**Driver:** Register → verify email → login → register as driver → wait for approval → go online → receive requests → accept → pickup → drop off → confirm payment

**Admin:** Login → dashboard with filterable list views for Rides, Drivers, Users, Payments
